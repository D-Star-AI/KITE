The majority opinion argued that the authority to institute such a large loan forgiveness program should rest with Congress.\n\nThe dissenting opinion was delivered by Justice Kagan, and argued that the plaintiff-States did not have the standing to bring this case, since they did not suffer direct financial harm.",

        "rubric": "Ideally the answer will say definitively that there was no dissenting opinion because the court sided unanimously with Sanofi. But it should still be considered a good answer is the answer says something along the lines of “I couldn’t find a dissenting opinion.” A bad answer is one that makes up a dissenting opinion."

        "gt_answer": "The core issue was that of enablement. A patent must provide sufficient detail to enable a person skilled in the art to reliably reproduce what is claimed. The cases cited by the court were all cases where patent claims were invalidated on the grounds on not providing sufficient enablement. Examples include Morse, Incandescent Lamp, and Holland Furniture.",

        "gt_answer": "The court upheld the lower courts’ ruling that Amgen’s claim on an entire genus of antibodies was invalid on the grounds of not providing enablement. Their claimed enablement was seen by the court as little more than an instruction to engage in trial and error.",

        "gt_answer": "Justice Barrett argued that Proposition 12 did create a substantial burden on interstate commerce, while the others argued it did not. But she agreed with the majority that the benefits and burdens of Proposition 12 are incommensurable, and therefore she agreed with the majority’s decision.",
        "rubric": "It’s important to note that Justice Barrett did not dissent, but merely provided a concurring opinion. An answer that states she dissented should be heavily penalized."

        "query": "What is the dormant commerce clause and how is it relevant to National Pork Producers Council v. Ross?",
        "gt_answer": "The dormant Commerce Clause is a reading of the Commerce Clause that includes an additional negative command that effectively forbids the enforcement of certain state economic regulations, even when Congress has not legislated on the subject. In Guy v. Baltimore, the Court held that state laws offend the Commerce Clause when they seek to build up domestic commerce through burdens on the industry and business of other States. This antidiscrimation reading of the clause is the primary one supported by precedent.\n\nIn National Pork Producers v. Ross, there was no antidiscrimination argument put forward. Instead, the plaintiffs put forward an interpretation of the dormant Commerce Clause that focused on harms to out-of-state firms relative to the local benefit.",
        "rubric": "The antidiscrimination part is a subtle but important part of this answer. A great answer will clearly differentiate between the antidiscrimination interpretation of the dormant Commerce Clause supported by precedent, and the more novel form put forth by the plaintiffs in this case."

        "gt_answer": "In Free Enterprise Fund, the Court found no meaningful judicial review because some Board actions never go to the SEC, so there may never be judicial recourse. In Axon, the Court acknowledges that eventual judicial review is available, but finds it would come too late to remedy the 'here-and-now injury' of being subjected to allegedly unconstitutional proceedings.",
        "rubric": "A full credit answer should explain: 1) The key difference in Free Enterprise Fund was the separation between Board and SEC actions, 2) In Axon, eventual review is available but comes too late, 3) The focus in Axon is on remedying the immediate injury of undergoing allegedly unconstitutional proceedings. Partial credit for identifying some but not all of these key points."

        "gt_answer": "Justice Gorsuch argues that the Thunder Basin approach: 1) Defies the rule that Congress, not courts, defines federal jurisdiction, 2) Creates an incoherent and confusing multi-factor test, 3) Imposes serious costs on litigants and lower courts by making jurisdiction unclear, 4) Deters people from seeking judicial review they are entitled to, and 5) Allows agencies to leverage the uncertainty to extract unfair settlements.",

        "gt_answer": "The Court acknowledged that much of the EEOC's guidance in this area is sensible and will likely be unaffected by the Court's clarifying decision. However, the Court declined to ratify the EEOC's entire body of interpretation, noting it had not benefited from the clarification provided in this decision. The Court stated it would not be prudent to fully endorse EEOC guidance that was based on the mistaken 'de minimis' interpretation of Hardison.",
        "rubric": "A complete answer should note that the Court recognized much of the EEOC's guidance as sensible and likely to remain valid. However, it should also explain that the Court declined to fully endorse or ratify all EEOC interpretations, given that they were based on the mistaken 'de minimis' standard. The answer should convey that the Court took a middle ground - not rejecting EEOC guidance wholesale, but also not fully embracing it given the clarification provided in this decision."

        "query": "What did the Supreme Court in Groff v. DeJoy say about how Title VII's requirement that an employer 'reasonably accommodate' an employee's religious practice should be interpreted?",
        "gt_answer": "The Court clarified that Title VII requires an employer to reasonably accommodate an employee's religious practice, not merely assess the reasonableness of a particular possible accommodation. The Court stated that faced with an accommodation request, it would not be enough for an employer to only consider one option (like forcing other employees to work overtime) and conclude it would be an undue hardship. Consideration of other options, such as voluntary shift swapping, would also be necessary.",
        "rubric": "A complete answer should explain that the Court interpreted Title VII as requiring employers to actually reasonably accommodate religious practices, not just assess the reasonableness of accommodations. It should note that employers must consider multiple accommodation options, not just reject one as an undue hardship. The answer should provide the example given by the Court - that an employer cannot just conclude forcing overtime would be a hardship, but must also consider options like voluntary shift swaps."

        "gt_answer": "The Court provided the following guidance: 1) Courts should focus on whether defendants consciously and culpably participated in the specific tort at issue; 2) The more attenuated the nexus between the defendant's acts and the tort, the more courts should demand showing of culpable participation through intentional aid that substantially furthered the tort; 3) If a plaintiff's theory would hold a defendant liable for all torts of an enterprise, a showing of pervasive and systemic aid is required; 4) Courts should not rigidly apply Halberstam's elements and factors, but understand them in light of common law principles; 5) The analysis should consider the relationship between the defendant and the tort, the defendant's state of mind, and the nature and extent of assistance provided; 6) Mere provision of widely available services or passive failure to prevent misuse is generally insufficient without more to establish liability.",
        "rubric": "A complete answer should identify multiple aspects of the Court's guidance, including the focus on conscious and culpable participation, the sliding scale between nexus and culpability, requirements for enterprise-wide liability, flexible application of Halberstam, key factors to consider, and insufficiency of mere service provision. The key is demonstrating understanding of the principles the Court emphasized for analyzing future cases."

Taamneh, what are the key elements required to establish aiding and abetting liability under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(d)(2)? How did the Court interpret the phrase \"aids and abets, by knowingly providing substantial assistance\"?",
        "gt_answer": "The Court interpreted \u00a7 2333(d)(2) as requiring that the defendant consciously and culpably participated in the tortious act in a way that helped make it succeed. Specifically, the Court pointed to the elements and factors articulated in Halberstam v. Welch as providing the framework, but said these should be understood in light of common law principles and applied flexibly. The key elements are: 1) There must be a wrongful act causing injury performed by the person the defendant aided; 2) The defendant must have been generally aware of their role in an overall illegal or tortious activity; 3) The defendant must have knowingly and substantially assisted the principal violation. The Court emphasized that the assistance must be to the specific act of international terrorism that injured the plaintiffs, though a strict nexus is not always required.",
        "rubric": "A complete answer should mention the Halberstam framework, the three key elements, the need for conscious and culpable participation, and that assistance must be to the specific terrorist act (though not necessarily with a strict nexus). It should also note that the Court said the elements should be applied flexibly in light of common law principles."

        "gt_answer": "The dissent argues that the statutory history actually shows Congress repeatedly expanded the scope of the law, including by removing terms like 'solicit' and 'assist' that the majority reads back into the statute. The dissent contends the majority's 'cleanup project' theory ignores the presumption that changes in statutory language convey changes in meaning.",

He points out that the text of Section 2 establishes an effects test, not just an intent test. Kavanaugh notes that Section 2 and Gingles require considering race in some circumstances to prevent cracking or packing of minority populations, whether intentional or not.",
        "rubric": "A complete answer should include: 1) Kavanaugh's rejection of sole reliance on race-blind simulations, 2) The distinction between effects test and intent test in Section 2, 3) The necessity of considering race in some circumstances under Section 2 and Gingles."

        "gt_answer": "Justice Kavanaugh agrees with the Court that Alabama's redistricting plan violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act as interpreted in Thornburg v. Gingles. However, he writes separately to address some of Alabama's key arguments and emphasize certain points about the Section 2 analysis under Gingles, such as the high bar for overruling statutory precedent, the rejection of mandatory proportionality, and the necessity of considering race in some circumstances.",
        "rubric": "A complete answer should include: 1) Kavanaugh's agreement with the majority on the violation of Section 2, 2) His decision to write separately to address specific arguments, 3) At least two examples of points he emphasizes (e.g. statutory stare decisis, rejection of proportionality, consideration of race)."
