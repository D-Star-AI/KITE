The process is divided into two main phases: a pre-processing phase and a code iterations phase.\n\nThe flow stages of AlphaCodium are as follows:\n\n1. **Problem Reflection**: Describe the problem in bullet points, addressing the problem's goal, inputs, outputs, rules, constraints, and other relevant details from the problem description.\n\n2. **Public Tests Reasoning**: Explain why each test input leads to its corresponding output.\n\n3. **Generate Possible Solutions**: Generate a list of 2-3 possible solutions to the problem, described in natural language.\n\n4. **Rank Solutions**: Rank the possible solutions based on correctness, simplicity, and robustness, choosing the \"best solution\" rather than necessarily the most efficient one.\n\n5. **Generate Additional AI Tests**: Create an additional 6-8 diverse input-output tests for the problem that cover cases and aspects not addressed by the original public tests.\n\n6. **Initial Code Solution**: Generate an initial code solution that is reasonably close to the correct code. Run this code on selected public and AI tests, iterating until the tests pass or a try-limit is reached. The first code that passes the tests or the code with the closest output will be used as the base code for the next steps.\n\n7. **Iterate on Public Tests**: Start from the base code and iteratively run it on the public tests.

This method addresses the issue where LLMs often struggle with tasks that require strict, non-trivial decisions, such as generating additional tests for a problem. In many cases, the initial tests generated by the model may contain errors.\n\nTo incorporate this concept into the system, AlphaCodium introduces an extra step of validation. After the model generates an output, such as a set of tests, it is then asked to re-generate the same output but with a focus on correcting any errors that may exist. For example, if the model has generated a set of AI tests, it is then tasked with re-generating these tests while fixing any incorrect outputs. This step encourages the model to critically evaluate its initial output and apply reasoning to correct mistakes.\n\nThis approach is found to be more effective than simply asking the model a direct yes/no question about the correctness of the tests. By asking the model to re-generate and correct the output, it engages in a more thorough review process, which leads to higher quality results and fewer errors.\n\nThe soft decision with double validation is part of a broader strategy in AlphaCodium to improve code generation by avoiding direct questions that can lead to hallucinations and incorrect answers, and instead fostering a more exploratory and iterative approach to problem-solving.",

Code generated by large language models (LLMs) often contains single quotes, double quotes, special characters, etc. LLMs would struggle to correctly place these characters inside a JSON format because JSON output needs to be surrounded by initial double quotes, which can be problematic for such characters.\n\n2. YAML output with block scalars only needs to obey indentation rules. Any text or code with proper indentation will be a legal YAML output, which is not the case with JSON that requires additional formatting.\n\n3.

        "gt_answer": "The InPars method addresses computational cost by using large language models only to generate synthetic training data, not for actual retrieval. This allows smaller, faster models to be fine-tuned on the synthetic data and used for retrieval at inference time. The paper shows that models fine-tuned on InPars-generated data outperform direct use of large language models like GPT-3 for retrieval, while being much more computationally efficient. The method also avoids expensive reranking of many documents per query, which is often required when using large language models directly for retrieval.",
        "rubric": "A complete answer should mention: 1) Use of large models only for data generation, not retrieval, 2) Fine-tuning smaller models on synthetic data, 3) Comparison of performance to direct use of large models, 4) Computational efficiency gains, 5) Avoidance of expensive reranking. The answer should clearly explain how these aspects address the computational cost issue.",

        "response": "The InPars paper addresses the issue of computational cost by using large language models to generate synthetic training data in a few-shot manner, rather than using them directly in the retrieval process. This approach allows for the fine-tuning of retrieval models on the generated data, which is more computationally efficient than using large models for direct retrieval tasks. Additionally, dense retrievers are used to avoid the expensive reranking step by precomputing vector representations for documents, further reducing computational demands."

        "gt_answer": "The paper describes creating the multilingual training set by first translating the entire MS MARCO dataset into multiple target languages. Then, they construct a set of multilingual triples by selecting the same queries and passages as in the original dataset, but randomly replacing them with their translations. They ensure that the query and its respective positive and negative passages are always in the same language within a triple. While they translated MS MARCO into 13 languages, the multilingual training set was created using 9 languages, including English.",
