It operates through an iterative process that involves reasoning about the problem in natural language and then generating, running, and fixing solution code against a set of tests. The process is divided into two main phases: a pre-processing phase and a code iterations phase.\n\nThe flow stages of AlphaCodium are as follows:\n\n1. **Problem Reflection**: Describe the problem in bullet points, addressing the problem's goal, inputs, outputs, rules, constraints, and other relevant details from the problem description.\n\n2. **Public Tests Reasoning**: Explain why each test input leads to its corresponding output.\n\n3. **Generate Possible Solutions**: Generate a list of 2-3 possible solutions to the problem, described in natural language.\n\n4. **Rank Solutions**: Rank the possible solutions based on correctness, simplicity, and robustness, choosing the \"best solution\" rather than necessarily the most efficient one.\n\n5. **Generate Additional AI Tests**: Create an additional 6-8 diverse input-output tests for the problem that cover cases and aspects not addressed by the original public tests.\n\n6. **Initial Code Solution**: Generate an initial code solution that is reasonably close to the correct code. Run this code on selected public and AI tests, iterating until the tests pass or a try-limit is reached. The first code that passes the tests or the code with the closest output will be used as the base code for the next steps.\n\n7. **Iterate on Public Tests**: Start from the base code and iteratively run it on the public tests. If the code fails on a specific test, attempt to fix it based on the error message.\n\n8. **Iterate on AI-generated Tests**: Continue the run-fix iterations on the AI-generated tests, using \"test anchors\" to ensure that any code fixes do not break previously passed tests.",

This method addresses the issue where LLMs often struggle with tasks that require strict, non-trivial decisions, such as generating additional tests for a problem. In many cases, the initial tests generated by the model may contain errors.\n\nTo incorporate this concept into the system, AlphaCodium introduces an extra step of validation. After the model generates an output, such as a set of tests, it is then asked to re-generate the same output but with a focus on correcting any errors that may exist. For example, if the model has generated a set of AI tests, it is then tasked with re-generating these tests while fixing any incorrect outputs. This step encourages the model to critically evaluate its initial output and apply reasoning to correct mistakes.\n\nThis approach is found to be more effective than simply asking the model a direct yes/no question about the correctness of the tests. By asking the model to re-generate and correct the output, it engages in a more thorough review process, which leads to higher quality results and fewer errors.\n\nThe soft decision with double validation is part of a broader strategy in AlphaCodium to improve code generation by avoiding direct questions that can lead to hallucinations and incorrect answers, and instead fostering a more exploratory and iterative approach to problem-solving.",

Code generated by large language models (LLMs) often contains single quotes, double quotes, special characters, etc. LLMs would struggle to correctly place these characters inside a JSON format because JSON output needs to be surrounded by initial double quotes, which can be problematic for such characters.\n\n2. YAML output with block scalars only needs to obey indentation rules. Any text or code with proper indentation will be a legal YAML output, which is not the case with JSON that requires additional formatting.\n\n3.

This reduction in tokens decreases cost and inference time and results in increased quality because the model needs to pay attention to fewer non-essential tokens.\n\nThese points suggest that YAML is more flexible and less error-prone when dealing with the complexities of code generation, making it a more suitable choice for the tasks described in the AlphaCodium paper.",

        "gt_answer": "The key advantages are: 1) It is more computationally efficient, avoiding the need to run large models at inference time. 2) It allows adaptation to any collection or IR task due to its few-shot nature. 3) It does not require expensive reranking of many documents per query. 4) It enables the use of smaller, faster models for actual retrieval after training on synthetic data. 5) It does not require any pretraining or loss function modifications.",
        "rubric": "A complete answer should mention: computational efficiency, adaptability to different tasks/collections, avoiding expensive reranking, enabling use of smaller models, and not requiring pretraining or loss function changes. The answer should explain how these are advantages over direct use of large language models.",
        "model_answer": "The key advantages of the InPars method compared to directly using large language models for retrieval are:\n\n1. **Cost-Effectiveness**: InPars uses large language models to generate synthetic training data rather than directly in the retrieval process, which is computationally expensive. This approach reduces the cost associated with using large models for reranking tasks.\n\n2. **Improved Performance**: The method outperforms strong baselines and recently proposed self-supervised dense retrieval methods. It achieves better zero-shot transfer when combined with supervised finetuning.\n\n3. **Domain Adaptation**: InPars allows for adaptation to specific IR tasks or domains by generating domain-specific synthetic data, which improves performance compared to using a general-purpose dataset.\n\n4. **Few-Shot Learning**: The method leverages the few-shot capabilities of large language models to generate synthetic data with minimal supervision, making it feasible to adapt retrievers to various collections or tasks without extensive labeled data.",

This approach allows for the fine-tuning of retrieval models on the synthetic data, which can then be used to rerank search results with lower inference costs.
