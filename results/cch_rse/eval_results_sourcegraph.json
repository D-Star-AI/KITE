This includes multi-repo context fetching and removing third-party dependencies for embeddings.\n\n2. **Bring Your Own Model**: Enabling customers to use their own models, such as Anthropic or OpenAI, and customize prompts.\n\n3. **IDE Extension Usage**: Experimenting with editor extensions across various IDEs to find the best user experience.\n\n4. **Extensibility**: Making Cody extensible with user-added recipes and plugins, and integrating it into the Sourcegraph web app.\n\n5. **App as Backend**: Distributing Cody to individual users and small teams by using the app as a backend.\n\n6. **Further Development**: Experimenting with self-hosted LLMs, more editor integrations, and platform features for data ingestion.",
