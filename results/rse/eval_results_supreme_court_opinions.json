This antidiscrimation reading of the clause is the primary one supported by precedent.\n\nIn National Pork Producers v. Ross, there was no antidiscrimination argument put forward.

Ross, the dormant Commerce Clause is relevant because the petitioners argued that California's Proposition 12, which regulates the sale of pork within the state, unconstitutionally interferes with interstate commerce. They claimed that the law imposes burdens on out-of-state pork producers, despite not being discriminatory on its face. However, the court rejected the petitioners' claims, as they failed to demonstrate a substantial burden on interstate commerce as required by the Pike balancing test, and the law did not purposefully discriminate against out-of-state economic interests.",
